Fix a chowdsp_DelayLine port-away-from-juce ownership issue (#8178)

which caused a sprint reverb crash

Basically the lifetime of the audio block overlay is different
than the block which is why originally there was an external heap
block. Restore that ownership with the vector buffer and avoid an
occasional mis-owned crash

Closes #8177
