Correct Tx 2, 4, 6 and 8 waveforms (#8173)

When writing Six Sines I realized the forms we had for TX 245 and 8
were too "spiky" and while these matched the manual they didn't matc
a scope from a TX which was really just doubled shifted cos etc...

So port that fix back here from six sines and add the 4 legacy
even shapes as new modes and adjust streaming.

Keep the alias oscillator having the old shapes only.
