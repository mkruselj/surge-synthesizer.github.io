Filter analysis overlay gets value popup and some fixes (#8081)

The cursor hotzone was offset upwards by 18 px because when hotzone rect was assigned, this apparently didn't take the current juce::Graphics context transform into account, so it needed an additional translate.

The cursor was moving even when clicking outside of the plot bounds.

Minimum resonance value was 0.51% and maximum cutoff also wasn't reachable, because while rx0 and rx1 had 1 subtracted from plot area's width/height, the calculation of current value along the axes used full width/height. So that needs 1 subtracted, too.

In process of fiddling here I also figured out a nicer node/popup overlap resolving method, so I backported that to MSEG editor as well.
