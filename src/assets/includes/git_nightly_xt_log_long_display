Keybinding improvements (#8086)

Keyboard shortcut descriptions are now following changes to binding, or even if the binding has been disabled.

Removed unnecessary overloads to showShortcutDescription() since it's now based on the KeyboardActions enum rather than literal strings.

Use the updated showShortcutDescription() method in KeyBindingsOverlay, to reduce code duplication.
