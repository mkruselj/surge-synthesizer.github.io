Migrate most of the FX parameter overlay into its own component. (#8164)

* Migrate most of the FX parameter overlay into its own component.

This moves the code that's laying it out, but generally doesn't move
ownership, which is an extremely complex beast in the Surge editor.

* Fix format and some debugs left in.

* Migrate label generation.

* Per-FX containers.

* Add effect-specific layouts and rendering.

* Some overall cleanup.
