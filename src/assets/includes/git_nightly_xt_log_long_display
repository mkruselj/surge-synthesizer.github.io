Remove juce dependency from BBDEnsemble and Neuron (#8168)

Modify chowdsp::DelayLineBase to no longer reply on the
relativlly trivial classes juce::AudioBlock and juce::ProcessorSpec
and juce::HeapBlock, replacing them with fairly standard allocating
delay lines and spec objects instead. Similarly replace juce::jmax with
std::max and so on.

Upshot: Neuron and BBDEnsemble no lnoger require juce::dsp.

Spring Reverb is harder. Working on that still.
